# Java_bank_class_project
Banking Project from Java class

This project was a more in-depth assignment. I was asked to create a facsimile of a banking app that
has the ability to withdraw, deposit, keep a balance, and had a menu. I added a credit score function
for fun and gave it an about me page and contact information. This was a difficult project but quite
satisfying when I was finished. I may go back and give it an overhaul with a different user interface.
